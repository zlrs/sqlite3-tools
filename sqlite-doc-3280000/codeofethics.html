Code Of Ethics

<h1 id="overview"><span>1. </span>Overview</h1>

<p>This document was originally called a "Code of Conduct" and
was created (in a slightly different format) for the purpose of
filling in a box on "supplier registration" forms
submitted to the SQLite developers by various minor clients.  However,
we subsequently learned that "Code of Conduct" has a specific technical
meaning within many software development communities, a meaning which
was at odds with the intent of this document.  Hence, this document
is now renamed and replaced by a 
<a href="codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> that does comply with the
specific technical requirements was inserted in the place of
the old name.

</p><p>
This document is still sometimes used as a "Code of Conduct" on supplier
registration forms.  But it is not a Code of Conduct in the same sense
that many communities mean a Code of Conduct.  Rather,
this document describes the ethical principles upon
which SQLite is based.  Another way to look at this document is
as a succinct description of the SQLite Founder's idea of what it
means to be "virtuous".

</p><p>
Readers can also interpret this document as a primer on the
world-view of the SQLite Founder, to help them better understand
"where he is coming from".

</p><h2 id="instruments_of_good_works"><span>1.1. </span>Instruments of Good Works</h2>

<p>The founder of SQLite, and all of the current developers at the time
when this document was composed, have pledged to govern their
interactions with each other, with their clients,
and with the larger SQLite user community in
accordance with the "instruments of good works" from chapter 4 of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict">The Rule of St. Benedict</a>
(hereafter: "The Rule").
This code of ethics has proven its mettle in thousands of diverse
communities for over 1,500 years, and has served as a baseline for many
civil law codes since the time of Charlemagne.

</p><h2 id="scope_of_application"><span>1.2. </span>Scope of Application</h2>

<p>
No one is required to follow The Rule, to know The Rule, or even
to think that The Rule is a good idea.  The Founder of SQLite believes
that anyone who follows The Rule will live a happier and more productive 
life, but individuals are free to dispute or ignore that advice if
they wish.

</p><p>
The founder of SQLite and all
current developers have pledged to follow spirit of The Rule
to the best of their ability. They
view The Rule as their promise to all SQLite users of how the developers
are expected to behave in community.
This is a one-way promise, or covenant.
In other words, the developers are saying: "We will treat you this
way regardless of how you treat us."
